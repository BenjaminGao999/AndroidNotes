recyclerView 



 /**

         *
         * <p>This can be used as a reasonable signal that the view is about to be seen
         * by the user. If the adapter previously freed any resources in
         * {@link #onViewDetachedFromWindow(RecyclerView.ViewHolder) onViewDetachedFromWindow}
         * those resources should be restored here.</p>
         *
         * @param holder Holder of the view being attached
         */
        public void onViewAttachedToWindow(VH holder) {
        }


注意是 holder
不是 adapter

adapter可以有很多类型的holder



        /**
         * Called when a view created by this adapter has been detached from its window.
         *
         * <p>Becoming detached from the window is not necessarily a permanent condition;
         * the consumer of an Adapter's views may choose to cache views offscreen while they
         * are not visible, attaching and detaching them as appropriate.</p>
         *
         * @param holder Holder of the view being detached
         */
        public void onViewDetachedFromWindow(VH holder) {
        }

## 我可以利用周的想法再结合我自己的想法， 就可以封装一个pullToRefreshRecyclerView控件了。
